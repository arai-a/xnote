    <h1>{addon} Updated</h1>
    <p>Thank you for updating {addon}. You are now running <b class="versionnumber">version {version}</b> on Thunderbird {appver}.</p>

    
    <p>{addon} requires fundamental changes in order to
      remain compatible with the Mozilla platform. Klaus Buecher/opto and Lorenz Froihofer are working to make {addon} fully 
      functional again. At lot of personal time has been put into this, already.  
    </p>
      
    
    
    <p>To help {addon} stay functional and alive:</p>  
    <ul class="actions">
          <li>Help out with a one time donation.</li>
    </ul>
 
    <h2>New/Hidden Features</h2>    
  
    
    <li>Preview notes on mouseover:</li>
    <p>If you display the xnotes column and widen it, so that the three dots are shown for a note, 
      but no text: then, on mouseover/hover, a little window will show the note text. The message does not need to be selected.
    This can be used to get a fast overview over all notes indicated in the messagelist.
  The number of characters shown can be chosen in the settings (tools->addon settings-> xnote++).</p>
  <p></p>
  <li>Keyboard operation:</li>
  <p>New note: Shift+F10 - x - c, Modify note: Shift+F10 - x -m, Delete note: Shift+F10 - x - d  (Varies by TB language. Some keyboards have a 
    'context menu' key, which can be used instead of shift+F10)</p>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>


    <h2>Help with a Donation!</h2>
    
    <p>Software  development costs time and money. This Add-on is not written
      by a large corporation, nor is it sponsored in any way by Mozilla.
      Mozilla only provides us with a platform to bring our software to you,
      the end users, in addons.thunderbird.net.</p>
      
    <p>In order to keep the addons working, Add-on authors have  to raise the funds
      necessary to repair and rewrite so that our users can keep benefiting
      from the functionality we bring to extend Thunderbird, even when Thunderbird 
      internals widely change, as happened in version 68 and version 78. </p>
