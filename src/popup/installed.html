      <h1>Successfully installed {addon} </h1>
        <p>Thank you for installing {addon}. You are now running {addon} <b>{version}</b> on Thunderbird {appver}.</p>
        
        <p>To help {addon} stay functional and alive:</p>
        <ul class="actions">
          <li>Help out with a one time donation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>New/Hidden Features</h2>    
  
    
        <li>Preview notes on mouseover:</li>
        <p>If you display the xnotes column and widen it, so that the three dots are shown for a note, 
          but no text: then, on mouseover/hover, a little window will show the note text. The message does not need to be selected.
        This can be used to get a fast overview over all notes indicated in the messagelist.
      The number of characters shown can be chosen in the settings (tools->addon settings-> xnote++).</p>
      <p></p>

            <p>Software  development costs time and money. This Add-on is not written
              by a large corporation, nor is it sponsored in any way by Mozilla.
              Mozilla only provides us with a platform to bring our software to you,
              the end users, in addons.thunderbird.net.</p>
              
            <p>In order to keep the addons working, Add-on authors have  to raise the funds
              necessary to repair and rewrite so that our users can keep benefiting
              from the functionality we bring to extend Thunderbird, even when Thunderbird 
              internals widely change, as happened in version 68 and version 78. </p>
