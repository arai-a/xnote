        <p>Thank you for installing {addon}. You are now running {addon} <b>{version}</b> on Thunderbird {appver}.</p>
        
        <p>To help {addon} stay functional and alive:</p>

          <li>Help out with a one time donation.</li>

        <p> Do we have any in XNote++?</p>  
        
        
        <h2>Help with a Donation!</h2>
        
        <p>Software  development costs time and money - unlike many platform apps,
          Add-ons are not written
          by large corporations, nor are they sponsored in any way by Mozilla.
          Mozilla only provide us with a platform to bring our software to you,
          the end users - if we need to charge or ask for help we cannot do
          this from addons.thunderbird.net - it is not an "app store" with built in
          paywalls or license management like iTunes or google play.</p>
          
        <p>In order to the addons working, Add-on authors have  now to raise the funds
          necessary to repair and rewrite so that our users can keep benefiting
          from the functionality we bring to extend Thunderbird. </p>
